<span class='anchor' id='about-me'></span>

I am a third-year graduate student majoring in the Biomedical Engineering at [Dalian University of Technology](https://www.dlut.edu.cn/)‚Äôs Faculty of Medicine. I‚Äôm working on medical imaging AI (computational pathology) under the supervision of Associate Professor [Hongming Xu](https://xhm1014.github.io/index.html). Before coming to Dalian University of Technology, I studied Electronic Information Engineering at the School of Information Science and Engineering, [Yanshan University](https://www.ysu.edu.cn/). Currently, I am focused on deep learning and computer vision, particularly in Multi-modal data analysis (e.g., image, gene), Generative AI (e.g., GANs), and Weakly supervised learning, to advance scientific discovery. Additionally, I am also interested in Diffusion model and Rubost AI (domain adaptation technich), etc.

My Chinese given name is Ê°ê (Tong), pronounced as Ê°ê/t ä≈ã/. My Chinese surname is Áéã (Wang), pronounced as Áéã/w…ëÀê≈ã/. It‚Äôs also fine to call me Tom.
